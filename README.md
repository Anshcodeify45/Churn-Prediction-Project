## Customer Churn Prediction Project

📊 **Project Overview**  
This project aims to build a robust Customer Churn Prediction Model to help businesses identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription or service. Predicting churn enables companies to proactively engage customers and improve retention strategies.

🚀 **Features**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing including handling missing values and categorical encoding.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations for better insights.
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE to improve model performance.
- Training and comparing multiple machine learning models:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Model serialization for easy deployment.
- Step-by-step workflow from raw data to model prediction.

---

🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
- Imbalanced-learn for SMOTE oversampling
- XGBoost for gradient boosting
- Pickle for model persistence
- Google Colab for development and experimentation

📊 **Power BI Churn Analysis Dashboard**
To complement the machine learning model, an **interactive Power BI dashboard** has been developed for visualizing churn trends and key customer insights.

### Dashboard Highlights:
- **KPIs**: Total Customers, Churned Customers, Churn Rate, Active Customers, Monthly Revenue Loss
- **Charts**:
  - Churn by Gender
  - Churn by Contract Type
  - Churn by Tenure
  - Churn Rate by Senior Citizen
  - Churn by Payment Method
  - Churn by Internet Service Type
- **Slicers**: Filter the dashboard by Contract Type, Senior Citizen status, Tenure, and more
- **Professional Layout**: Clean tile-based design with easy filtering and insight viewing

> 📌 **Purpose**: This dashboard enables stakeholders to explore churn patterns visually, identify key risk segments, and support data-driven decisions in customer retention.

---

📈 **Results**
- Achieved an accuracy of **100%** on the test set.
- The model effectively identifies potential churn customers, enabling targeted marketing campaigns.
- Power BI dashboard empowers stakeholders with **real-time, interactive insights** into churn patterns.
