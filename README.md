# Churn-Prediction-Project
Customer Churn Prediction Project
📊 Project Overview
This project aims to build a robust Customer Churn Prediction Model to help businesses identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription or service. Predicting churn enables companies to proactively engage customers and improve retention strategies.

🚀 Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing including handling missing values and categorical encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations for better insights.

Handling class imbalance with SMOTE to improve model performance.

Training and comparing multiple machine learning models:

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Model serialization for easy deployment.

Step-by-step workflow from raw data to model prediction.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation

Imbalanced-learn for SMOTE oversampling

XGBoost for gradient boosting

Pickle for model persistence

Google Colab for development and experimentation

📈 Results
Achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set.

Model effectively identifies potential churn customers enabling targeted marketing campaigns.
